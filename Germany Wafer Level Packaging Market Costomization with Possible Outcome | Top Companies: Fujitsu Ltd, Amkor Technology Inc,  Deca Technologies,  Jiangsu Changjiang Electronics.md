<strong>According to a recently published analytical study titled ""Global Wafer Level Packaging Market Industry Analysis, Comprehensive Forecast, and Opportunities Assessment (2025–2033),"" the report provides an in-depth evaluation of market trends, growth opportunities, and projections.</strong>

Wafer-level packaging (WLP) is the technology of packaging an integrated circuit while still part of the wafer, in contrast to the more conventional method of slicing the wafer into individual circuits (dice) and then packaging them. WLP is essentially a true chip-scale package (CSP) technology, since the resulting package is practically of the same size as the die.[1] Wafer-level packaging allows integration of wafer fab, packaging, test, and burn-in at wafer level in order to streamline the manufacturing process undergone by a device from silicon start to customer shipment.

Wafer-level packaging consists of extending the wafer fab processes to include device interconnection and device protection processes. Most other kinds of packaging do wafer dicing first, and then put the individual die in a plastic package and attach the solder bumps. Wafer-level packaging involves attaching the top and bottom outer layers of packaging, and the solder bumps, to integrated circuits while still in the wafer, and then wafer dicing.

There is no single industry-standard method of wafer-level packaging at present.

A major application area of WLPs are smartphones due to the size constraints.
